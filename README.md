## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more programming languages and their corresponding "G'day" code snippets. If you're contributing, please make sure to follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new file with the language name and extension (e.g., `gday.scala` for Scala).
2. Add the code snippet for printing "G'day" in that language.
3. Update the `README.md` file to include the new language in the list.
